# hello-world
A hello world project to start things off.

I'm working on a project to develop a notation for harmony, in binary, similar to figured bass and jazz charts. The computer should be able to analyze a chord *and* its function, and thus extrapolate (improvise) based on any input -- especially gesture and situation-tension.

The system is largely built, from an algorithmic point of view, and at present working in C as a Puredata external. 

I'd like to see if it can become a kind of ASCII standard for musical harmony. Mathematically, it is solid enough, and it can find root position easily for any input.

I am working to develop machine-learning interfaces so it can be intuitively and flexibly driven.

Current projects are centered around the machine learning course at Kadenze, and non-synthesized sounds are being run out to Native Instruments sounds in Kontakt.
